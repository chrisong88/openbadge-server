# The ORM

## Fields

### Identifiers

There are three types of identifiers in place:

* `id`s. These are sequential and auto-generated by BaseModel. As they 
    are non-random, they should not be used in any user-facing setting.
    
* `key`s. These are also auto generated by BAseModel. They are unique 
    and entirely random, allowing them to be user-facing
    
* `uuid`s. These are unique and Human-readable. They may be user-facing,
    but its probably better to use `key`s for all user facing accesses. 
    
## Methods

* `to_object`. This is generally what gets returned to `HTTP GET`s to a 
    particular Class. eg. `GET /:key/meeting` would call 
    `Meeting`'s `.to_object(*whatever*)`
     
* `__unicode__`. Django uses this to figure out how to present objects in
    a human readable format. Often this could be `return self.uuid`.
